## 🚀 What is TREE 2.0?

**TREE 2.0 is a command‑driven AI project framework built on top of Google Antigravity skills.**

It transforms Antigravity from a prompt-based assistant into a **structured project generator** that works like a development CLI.

You don’t write prompts anymore.  
You run a command:

```
tree init
```

And TREE takes control of the entire project flow.

## 🌟 Why TREE 2.0?

TREE 1.0 was a skill collection.  
TREE 2.0 is a **framework + controller + modular skill system**.

| TREE 1.0 | TREE 2.0 |
|----------|----------|
| Manual prompts | Command driven |
| “Using TREE skills…” | `tree init` |
| Skills used manually | Skills auto‑selected |
| Skill pack | Development framework |
| No project memory | `tree.config.md` + `.tree/` state |

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

TREE 2.0 introduces a **project brain file**:

```
tree.config.md
```

All skills read this file before generating anything.

This makes TREE **self‑orchestrating**.

---

## ⚙️ How TREE 2.0 Works

```
Install TREE
      ↓
Create new empty project
      ↓
Run: tree init
      ↓
Answer interview questions
      ↓
tree.config.md created
      ↓
Say: Build the project
      ↓
TREE selects & runs correct skills automatically
```

No need to mention skills. Ever.

## 📁 What Happens Inside Your Project

After `tree init`:

```
project/
 ├── tree.config.md
 └── .tree/
      ├── state.md
      └── logs.md
```

TREE now understands:

- Static or Dynamic
- Language
- Framework
- Project type

---

## 🧩 TREE 2.0 Architecture

```
TREE/
├── tree-init/   → Controller (entry command)
└── skills/      → Worker modules
```

- `tree-init` = interview + config creator
- `skills` = modules that generate parts of the project

Each skill reads `tree.config.md` before running.

# 🛠 Installation

### Step 1 — Clone TREE into Antigravity

```bash
cd C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.antigravity\.agent\skills
git clone https://github.com/livealyx/TREE.git
```

### Step 2 — Reload Skills

```bash
antigravity reload-skills
```

TREE 2.0 is now installed.

# 🚀 How to Start Any Project (TREE Way)

1. Create a new empty folder
2. Open it in Antigravity
3. Run:

```
tree init
```
4. Answer questions
5. Say:

```
Build the project
```

TREE generates everything.

---

## ❗ Important Rule

Do NOT say:

```
Using TREE skills
```

That was TREE 1.0.

TREE 2.0 is command‑based.

---

## 🏗 Example Flow

```
tree init
→ Dynamic
→ PHP
→ Tailwind
→ School Management System

Build the project
```

TREE will create:

- Backend structure
- UI structure
- Database schema
- Clean architecture

---

## 📦 Repository Structure

```
TREE/
├── tree-init/
└── skills/
```

Framework + modules design.

---

## 👨‍💻 Who Should Use TREE 2.0?

- Developers
- Freelancers
- Agencies
- Students
- AI automation enthusiasts
